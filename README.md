# SA:MP Discord Rich Presence plugin

This plugin features custom server logos. 

## How to add your own servers with custom logos:
If you'd like your server added to the custom logos list, [create an issue](https://github.com/Hual/samp-discord-plugin/issues) with a 512x512 logo (must be only either PNG, JPEG, or JPG) attached and your server's IP address.
